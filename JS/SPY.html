    <h1>Welcome to Part 9 : Your JavaScript Level One Project !</h1>
    <div>
        <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions
            to normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series
            of
            questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect . If all questions are answered
            correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the spy to read !
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="joy">Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:</div>

    <ul>
        <li>The Spy has the same first letter of his/her First Name and the Last Name.</li>
        <li>The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30(exclusive 20 & 30).</li>
        <li>The Spy is atleat 170 cm tall.</li>
        <li>The Spy has a nick name that ends with the letter 'y'.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are going to leave this project a little more open-ended,but if you feel like you need more
        guidance,check out the solution walkthrough videos! But Believe it or not, we've actuallycovered everything you
        need to know to complete this task. I would suggest you use Javascript to prompt the user for information and
        set these to variables. THen use these variables to check for the four conditions to all be true. It's up to you
        what the secret message is !!!
    </p>
    <div class="joy">A Spy with the FOllowing information should see your secret message:</div>

    <ul>
        <li>Devil Digvijay</li>
        <li>20 years old</li>
        <li>178cm tall</li>
        <li>Nick name is "Joy"</li>

    </ul>

    <p>Keep in mind you ask the question prompts in whatever order you want, you can even seperate asking for first name
        and then another prompt for last name.</p>
